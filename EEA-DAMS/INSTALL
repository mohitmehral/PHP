These instructions are for the purpose of getting quickly launched. For more
detailed instructions see docs/Users-guide.doc

----------------
1. Postgres install

    You can either install the RPM called postgresql-server or from source:

      ./configure
      gmake
      su
      gmake install
      adduser postgres
      mkdir /home/pgsql/data
      chown postgres /home/pgsql/data
      su - postgres
      initdb -D /home/pgsql/data

2. Start the database server

    If you have built from source:

      su - postgres
      postmaster -D /home/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &

    If you have installed from RPM:

      su - root
      /sbin/chkconfig postgresql on
      /sbin/service postgresql start

2. Install DB Data

      su - postgres

   Ensure psql is in your path. If postgresql is installed from source do:

      PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgsql/bin; export PATH

   We have prepared a dump file with the 

    createdb EEADAMS
    pg_restore --dbname=EEADAMS damsdb.pgsql

3. Install Apache Web server

4. Install PHP

   Version 4.x or 5.x is required

5. Install PEAR

  This normally comes as an RPM-package called php-pear on Redhat, but you'll
  need some more packages that you install with "pear install packageName":
  You need Auth, Config, DB, DB_DataObject, Date, Log, PEAR, Translation2

6. Install Smarty

   On Redhat the package is called php-Smarty

7. Copy website directory to your webserver

   Set up a virtual host on apache:

    NameVirtualHost *:80
    <VirtualHost *:80>
     ServerName dampos.eea.europa.eu
     ServerAlias dampos
     php_value memory_limit 33554432
     CustomLog /var/local/logs/dampos/access combined
     DocumentRoot /var/local/dampos/website
    </VirtualHost>


8. Set permissions

    These directories under website must be owned by apache and writable by the http server:
    tmp and templates/templates_c

9. Edit commons/inc-config.conf

10. Check filename for *.ini in DataObjects according to DB name

11. Log in for the first time.

  If you use the packaged database there is an account with the name 'dams' and
  the password 'dams'. As soon as you have launched you should change the
  password. You could do that even before you import the data. The password
  in the database is the md5 sum of the password, and you can generate a new
  one like this:
    php -r 'echo md5("newpw");'
  and change it in damsdb.pgsql
