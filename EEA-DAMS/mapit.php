 * EEA-DAMS mapit.php
 *
 * Dam exact position (expressed as geographical coordinates) is generally unavailable. 
 * A special process has been developed by the EEA (AIR3) to locate as 
 * accurately as possible the dams listed in the Icold register on large 
 * dams. This pre-location task is carried out by ETC/TE. The current 
 * number of large dams is ~6000 in the EEA area.
 * Following agreement with Icold, the national focal points of Icold 
 * will be requested to accept / correct the proposed location. These 
 * organisations are based in countries and know accurately where dams are, 
 * even though they do not systematically have the coordinates at their 
 * disposal. To check / correct the position, it has been considered that 
 * an Internet tool, providing an image of the most likely position 
 * and a facility to fix a new position by drag-and-drop a marker on the 
 * image would be the best solution from the point of view of minimizing 
 * the burden, avoiding copyright issues nevertheless ensuring security in 
 * transactions.
 * This arrangement follows the methodology of pre-positioning and 
 * positioning dams developed by AIR3 and delivered to the ETC/TE that 
 * has to carry out this work.
