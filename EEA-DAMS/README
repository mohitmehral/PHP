                       README FOR EEA-DAMS PACKAGE

Dam exact position (expressed as geographical coordinates) is generally
unavailable.  A special process has been developed by the EEA (AIR3) to
locate as accurately as possible the dams listed in the Icold register on
large dams. This pre-location task is carried out by ETC/TE. The current
number of large dams is ~6000 in the EEA area.  Following agreement
with Icold, the national focal points of Icold will be requested to
accept / correct the proposed location. These organisations are based
in countries and know accurately where dams are, even though they do
not systematically have the coordinates at their disposal. To check /
correct the position, it has been considered that an Internet tool,
providing an image of the most likely position and a facility to fix a
new position by drag-and-drop a marker on the image would be the best
solution from the point of view of minimizing the burden, avoiding
copyright issues nevertheless ensuring security in transactions.

This arrangement follows the methodology of pre-positioning and
positioning dams developed by AIR3 and delivered to the ETC/TE that has
to carry out this work.
