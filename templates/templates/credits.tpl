The maps and satellite images used on this website have been prepared with 
the collaboration of the following data providers:</p>
<ul>
    <li> (c) EEA 2004. Source: JRC: a satellite image mosaic (IMAGE2000) is used as background to localise the sites. 
    IMAGE2000 is based on a mosaic of LANDSAT 7 ETM+ images acquired by © ESA 1999-2002 and distributed by © Eurimage. 
    I&amp;CLC2000 is a joint project managed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the European Environment Agency (EEA) 
    to produce a spatial image reference dataset for Europe (IMAGE2000) and to update the Corine land cover database (CLC2000).
    Satellite images were geometrically corrected by © Metria 2001-2003 and © GISAT 2002.s.r.o. I&amp;CLC2000 project results are 
    co-owned by the participating countries and the European Community (http://image2000.jrc.it)</li>
