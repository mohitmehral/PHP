We are still committed to making all homes decent but some estates will take a little longer than where the scale of work to deliver mixed communities, or more new build, is significant;<br />To be classed as decent, a home must provide a reasonable degree of thermal comfort, which means it must have effective insulation and efficient heating. Improvements to insulation and heating are a major focus of the decent homes refurbishment works. Of the 1.6 million social homes, which were non-decent in 2001, 1.3 million (80 per cent) will require improvements to their insulation and/or heating systems in order to meet the target.<br />We are making progress.  According to local authority and registered social landlords estimates show that by April 2006 we had achieved an estimated reduction of 41 per cent in non-decent social homes to 976,000.  In the period from 2000-01 to 2004-05 local authorities report that over 470,000 dwellings have received work to improve their energy efficiency under the Decent Homes programme, or as part of wider local authority work to update the stock.  Research by the Building Research Establishment on the implementation of the Decent Homes programme indicates that the majority of improvement works under the Decent Homes scheme include work to improve energy efficiency.

The new landlord&rsquo;s energy saving allowance, announced in November 2004 will encourage private landlords to invest in the insulation of their properties.<br />Together with programmes such as Warm Front, measures under decent homes will help to deliver our target to increase the proportion of vulnerable households in the private sector who live in decent homes from 57 per cent in 2001 to 65 per cent by 2006, 70 per cent by 2010.

First, &lsquo;Agenda 2000&rsquo; saw some moderation in support for production subsidies and an increased emphasis on rural development measures including agri-environment schemes.  More significantly, both for changes in the agricultural sector and potential impact on greenhouse gas emissions, the Mid-Term Review reforms agreed in June 2003 made fundamental changes to the subsidy system, decoupling payments to farmers from incentives for production (implemented in England with the introduction of the Single Farm Payment), and making payments conditional on farmers reaching minimum environmental standards on a number of relevant issues.<br />The June 2003 reforms are likely to lead to the detectable changes in agricultural practice from the end of 2005.   There is considerable uncertainty in how farmers might react, but work commissioned by the UK Government  suggests that the reforms might lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, through;<br />&bull; lower inputs, including artificial fertilizers,<br />&bull; an increase in fallow land leading to less soil disturbance and possible reduction in loss of soil carbon; and<br />&bull; Reductions in livestock numbers that will promote a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, from animals directly and from manure and slurry handling.<br />Conversely, specialization and concentration in some sectors, especially cereals and dairying, may lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions, and a shift into high value horticultural or vegetable crops in some areas leading to higher levels of inputs of fertilizers with increased nitrous oxide emissions.  The UK Government will shortly be publishing its Biomass Strategy, which will include details of how it will increase the use of anaerobic digestion.

Higher Level Stewardship, along with the existing Countryside Stewardship (CSS) and Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) should have a significant local effect by promoting less intensive farming, with lower fertilizer inputs and reduced stocking rates.

There are also a number of Government policies aimed at reducing land filling of biodegradable waste. For example, the landfill tax was raised &pound;21 per tonne of active waste for the year 2006/07 to encourage more sustainable management of waste that would otherwise be land filled. The UK Government announced in 2003 that the tax would increase by at least &pound;3 per tonne of active waste per year from 2005-06 until it reached a level of &pound;35 per tonne. The Chancellor&#39;s 2006 Pre-Budget Report announced that the Government will consider whether the standard rate of landfill tax needs to increase more steeply from 2008 onwards, or go beyond &pound;35 per tonne. In addition, the Waste Strategy 2000 for England (currently under review following a consultation document in 2006) and the corresponding strategies for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set out a range of other policies designed to reduce waste production and recover value from waste that is produced through reuse, recycling/composting and energy recovery. The Wales Waste Strategy  is in place and is being reviewed this year. <br />The implementation of the European Community&rsquo;s Landfill Directive  will have a significant effect on emissions because it imposes strict engineering requirements on landfills.  It also requires landfill gas (methane) to be collected from all landfills receiving biodegradable waste and the landfill gas to be treated and used.  If the gas collected cannot be used to produce energy, it must be flared.  The Landfill Directive further imposes limits on the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) that can be land filled.The Landfill Directive further imposes limits on the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) that can be land filled.

Important elements of the development of urban transport include the construction of intelligent transport systems, the improvement of passenger information and comfort and ensuring clear access. <br />In Budapest, the completion and modernisation of the suburban rail service based on the existing railway infrastructure is of outstanding importance. The start of the modernisation of the 14 suburban railway lines extending into Budapest (including 11 M&Aacute;V and 3 H&Eacute;V lines) will facilitate the commuting of the population of Budapest agglomeration. The development also including railway terminals will enable that modern, comfortable, regularly scheduled and environmentally sound rail transport gain prominence over individual automotive transport causing congestion, traffic jams and considerable environmental pollution. The possibility of solutions using the rail and permanent-track urban infrastructure without changing between transport vehicles should also be considered for suburban railway developments. The construction of a third and fourth track may become necessary on the TEN elements leading to Budapest in order to ensure undisturbed passenger traffic, isolated from goods transport. <br />The possibilities of linking up local and non-local public transport systems should also be considered for major provincial cities. This can be done by the establishment of intermodal centres or by extending the tram lines toward nearby settlements (operating trams as suburban trains). The horizontal objectives of environmental protection and equal opportunities must be given increased priority on drawing up and implementing the developments defined. <br />As a result of these developments the new underground line considerably improving the traversability of the capital will be completed and the modernisation of the suburban train service will commence.
